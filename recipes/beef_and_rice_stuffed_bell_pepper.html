    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These stuffed bell peppers with rice are worth a try! Ninety-four percent of all stuffed peppers are made because there's leftover rice around. You can adjust this recipe in many different ways: the herbs, the meat, etc. Any ground meat works: lamb, pork, or an equal mixture of sausage and beef is fantastic. I used lean beef, but I recommend trying 1 pound beef with 1/2 pound pork sausage.    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 bell peppers</li>

        <li>   3 cups chunky tomato sauce, divided</li>
            
        <li>  ½ onion, very thinly sliced</li>
            
        <li>  1 cup beef broth</li>
            
        <li>  ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            
        <li>  1 ½ pounds lean ground beef</li>
            
        <li>   1 ½ cups cooked rice</li>
            
        <li>  ½ cup freshly shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
            
        <li>  ¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
            
        <li>  4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            
        <li>  2 teaspoons salt</li>
            
        <li>  ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            
        <li>  tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
        <p>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
        <p>Slice peppers 1/2-inch from the top; cut out stems and set aside tops. Cut core from the inside of peppers and strip away any seeds. Cut off a thin slice from the bottoms so peppers can stand upright. Poke about 4 tiny holes in the bottoms to let juices drain.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
        <p>
            Pour 2 1/2 cups tomato sauce into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Add onion, beef broth, and red pepper flakes; spread out mixture evenly over the bottom.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
        <p>
            Set bell peppers upright in the dish.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li>
        <p>
            Combine ground beef, cooked rice, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, 2 tablespoons tomato sauce, 1/4 cup parsley, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a large mixing bowl.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step 6</strong></li>
        <p>
            Lightly stuff peppers with meat mixture. Spread 1 tablespoon tomato sauce on top of each portion of stuffing; place reserved tops onto peppers. Lay a piece of parchment paper loosely on top of peppers and cover the dish tightly with foil. Place the dish on top of a baking sheet.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step 7</strong></li>
        <p>
            Bake in the preheated oven until peppers have softened slightly, about 1 hour. Remove foil and parchment paper. Continue baking until meat filling is cooked through and peppers are tender, 20 to 30 more minutes.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step 8</strong></li>
        <p>
            Sprinkle each pepper with 1/2 teaspoon parsley and drizzle with a spoonful of pan juices.
        </p>
    </ol>
